title: Introduction to ifpd
---

The ifpd package aim is to simplify the design of fluorescence *in situ* hybridization probes, starting from databases of oligonucleotides designed to *specifically* bind to genomic loci of interest. the package contains tools to design a single probe, comprising a specific number of oligonucleotide sequences. Alternatively, it also allows to design anumber of homogeneously spread probes, covering a region of interest, in a fashion that we dubbed *spotting* probe.

ifpd is fully implemented in Python3, and is distributed throught the PyPI network: the Python Package Manager developed and maintained by the Python community, for the Python community.

Very brief intro on the idea behind ifpd. Concept of database (more details in relative page) and why we need it. Then, two query systems and algorithms in relative page.

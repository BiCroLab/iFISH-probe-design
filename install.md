# Installation

If you have Python3 and `pip3` installed on your computer, you can simply run `sudo -H pip3 install ifpd` on a terminal. That's it! As easy as it gets.

You can also install from github (any point in history, although we suggest to stick with release tags) as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggirelli/iFISH-probe-design/
cd iFISH-probe-design
sudo -H pip3 install .
```

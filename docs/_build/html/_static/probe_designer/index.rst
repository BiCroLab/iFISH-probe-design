Index
=====

The ``index`` page provides the tool to locate a query, navigate through its result, and check the current queue.

Query table
-----------

A table is available showing the past queries. Failed queries are kept at the bottom of the table. The first column of the table contains the query ID, which is a link to the ``query`` page, where the actual results are reported. Then, general information on every query are present in the other columns, with the expection of the last, where a link is present to download the query results in ``.zip`` format.

Search a query
--------------

Just before the table, a small form is available to search through the queries based on their name (second column). To use it, just type in a part or the whole name of the query you are looking for and press ``enter``.

Queue
-----

On the right (or bottom, in small devices) of the page, the `Queue` panel shows how many and which queries are in the queue, waiting to be executed.

Queries that were **interrupted** due to any error are reported in red, with a funny small emoji.

Queries that are **still running** are reported in green.

Candidate page
==============

This page contains information on a specific probe candidate. Three panels are available: **plots**, **settings**, **fasta/bed**.

Plots
-----

Four plots are produced per probe candidate:

1. The first one (on top) shows the oligo distribution in the genomic region covered by the probe. The oligo middle points are highlighted by dotted vertical cyan lines.
2. The left plot shows the position of the probe in the queried genomic region of interest (GRoI, black). The middle point of the probe (cyan) and of the GRoI are highlighted by dashed line, respectively in cyan and red.
3. The middle plot shows the oligo middle points as red dots, and a black line showing their expected position if homogeneously spread. Bigger deviations from the black line indicate less homogeneous probes.
4. The right plot shows the density distribution (and histogram) of the distance between consecutive oligomers, in the probe candidate.

Settings
--------

Information on the probe candidate are reported here.

Fasta/bed
---------

By selecting the ``fasta`` or ``bed`` tab, the content of the two candidate files is shown in the panel. The download button on the top-right corner of the panel will allow to download the selected file. The **eye** button (right beside the download) redirects to BLAT.

# How to extract/generate a database

To run, `FISH-ProDe` requires at least one database to be located in the `db/` folder. Each database should consists of a folder with one txt file per chromosome, containing an ordered list of oligonucleotide start sites. The length of the oligonucleotides should be encoded in the database folder name (e.g., `kmerXX_...`).

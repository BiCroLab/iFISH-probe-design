[dev] Setup
===========

When setting up ``probe_designer`` for the first time, the folders ``db`` and ``query`` should be created in the section main folder. The ``db`` folder will host the extracted databases, while the ``query`` folder will contain the run queries output.

The ``extract_database.py`` should be manually run to generate new databases. Once the database is generated in the ``db`` folder, it is automatically rendered available to the query interface. More details are available in the ``[dev] Database`` page.
